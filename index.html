            <p>Hey! My name is Brinkley Boyer and I live in Laie, Hawaii! Some of my favorite hobbies include; hiking, surfing, playing sports, and watching movies. I am one of five children. I have one older brother and three younger sisters. I grew up in Rockland, Idaho, but I've been moving around quite a bit since I graduated high school. I've lived in Thailand, Louisiana, Mississippi, Utah, and now Hawaii. I would love to one day have my own graphic design business. Making logos and brand identities have always been so fun to me and I'd love to make a career out of it. I'm still currently in the beginning stages of this dream but I hope to keep progressing this year.</p>
